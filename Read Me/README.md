# HW-1-HTML-CSS Overview 
In this repo I have changed the div classes and added semantic styling. I have also consolidated the CSS. Throught the HTML and CSS I have added comments to explain what is happening in the code. This repo demonstrates and understanding of HTML and CSS.

## Description 
The following repo host the first homework assignment. The instricutions asked us to refactor the code in order to make it accessible. We were asked to deliver the following ticket for the client. The client has provided the following user story and acceptance criteria. 

## User Story
